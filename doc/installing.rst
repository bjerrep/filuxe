Dependencies
============

A couple of python libraries are required, see ./requirements.txt.

Filuxe has been written on an Arch system with all python dependencies installed as native packages.

Be warned that bringing Filuxe up on e.g. an older Ubuntu with stale python dependencies might be a little challenging.

Definitely picked up more nice stuff made by others than listed here, but at least there was an attempt:
